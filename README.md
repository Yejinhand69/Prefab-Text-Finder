# Prefab Text Finder🔍

A Unity Editor tool for locating and managing `TextMeshProUGUI` components inside prefab assets — built to streamline localization workflows and integration with [I2 Localization](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/localization/i2-localization-14884).

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Find all `TextMeshProUGUI` components** in prefabs
- 🧭 **Filter by open prefab or scan entire project**
- 📄 **Paginated display** (10 per page by default)
- 🌐 **I2 Localization support**
  - View terms and add translations
  - Language dropdown with language codes
- 🧪 **Google Translate integration**
- 🗂️ **Scene-by-scene prefab grouping** (based on build order)

## 📦 Use Case

Prefab Text Finder is ideal for teams/localizers working with large-scale Unity projects using prefabs for UI. Instead of manually inspecting each prefab, this tool exposes all text components for review, selection, and direct localization.

## 🛠️ How To Use

1. Open Unity and go to: `Tools > Localization > Prefab Text Finder`
2. Click `Scan Project` to find all prefab-based text objects
3. Or use `Scan Open Prefab` to only search inside the current prefab being edited
4. View and page through the results
5. Translate the selected prefab using the `Translate All` button
6. Use `Insert into Language Source` button to complete I2 insertion
